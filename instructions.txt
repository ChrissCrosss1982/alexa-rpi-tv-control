Getting software installed on your RPi

>> update your system
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

>> update pip
sudo -H pip3 install —upgrade pip

  >> install flask-ask
 pip3 install flask-ask

>> install grok
https://ngrok.com/download 
Download and unzip ngrok

>> install lirc
sudo apt-get install lirc

Setting up lirc

>> Add the following to the /boot/config.txt
lirc_rpi gpio_in_pin=23 gpio_out_pin=22

>> Edit the file /etc/lirc/lirc_options.conf 

Change:

from:
driver  = devinput
device  = auto

to:
driver  = default
device  = /dev/lirc0

Save and Reboot

lirc operation
>> Start/Stop the licrd service
sudo /etc/init.d/lircd stop
sudo /etc/init.d/lircd start

>> Check status to determine if lirc is running
sudo /etc/init.d/lircd status

>> To test if lirc driver is working  -- First wire up your circuit and connect to the Raspberry Pi 
sudo /etc/init.d/lircd stop

mode2 -d /dev/lirc0
<press a key in remote and you should see multple lines like below>
pulse 560
space 1706
pulse 535

>> Recording a custom remote/registering a remote device
sudo /etc/init.d/lircd stop
sudo irrecord -d /dev/lirc0 ~/lircd.conf
# follow the instructions prompted by the above command carefully
# at the end a ~/device-name.lircd.conf file will be generated

>> Backup the original lircd.conf
sudo mv /etc/lirc/lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd_original.conf
sudo cp ~/device-name.lircd.conf /etc/lirc/lircd.conf
sudo /etc/init.d/lircd start

# you can test if the recorded remote works by
$ irsend SEND_ONCE <device-name> KEY_POWER
$ irsend SEND_ONCE <device-name> KEY_VOLUMEUP


>> Testing the IR circuit and control on your Raspberry Pi
Build the Circuit for the Project and connect it to the Raspberry Pi
Copy the Python Code for the project to the Raspberry Pi
Run the test program to ensure that ir signals to the TV works

e.g.

python3 test.py power on
python3 test.py volume increase
python3 test.py channel 25

Tweak as necessary to ensure the functions work
Change any corresponding commands as needed in the Skill Program   >> Start the python skill handler and ngrok

>> Get the https endpoint
python3 my-tv.py
./ngrok http 5000

>> Setup the Alexa Skill
Log into the Amazon Developer Portal
Create the MyTV Skill
Upload the JSON spec for the skill
Update the endpoint
Test the Skill
